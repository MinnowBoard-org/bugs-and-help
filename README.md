# MinnowBoard.org: Bugs and Help

## Purpose

The **bugs-and-help** repository is used to track bugs and help requests for the [MinnowBoard](https://minnowboard.org) open source hardware and software program. If you're having a problem you haven't found an answer to, the [issues](https://github.com/minnowboard-org/bugs-and-help/issues) database for the bugs-and-help project is the right place to go.

If you're looking for other ways to contact the MinnowBoard developers, see [MinnowBoard.org/help](https://minnowboard.org/help) for other contact options.

Any user with a GitHub account can submit an issue under the [Issues tab](https://github.com/minnowboard-org/bugs-and-help/issues). 

MinnowBoard foundation members and collaborators are monitoring new issues and helping to provide resolution. We are a small team, but we strive to respond as quickly as possible.

## What kind of issues should I submit?

If you're having a problem, and you've found this page looking for an answer, you should [file an issue](https://github.com/minnowboard-org/bugs-and-help/issues). When you file a problem, please help us understand the environment causing the problem. Provide information about:

* What hardware are you using?
  For example MinnowBoard Turbot. For information on finding out what board you have, see [MinnowBoard.org/get-a-board](https://minnowboard.org/get-a-board)
* What operating system are you running?
* What power supply are you using?
* What firmware version are you using?
  For information on finding the firmware version, see [MinnowBoard.org/tutorials/updating_your_firmware](https://minnowboard.org/tutorials/updating_your_firmware)

The MinnowBoard program ecompasses hardware, firmware, many operating systems, and other software functionality. As such, issues often cross many technical domains--the more information you provide with your issue, the better.
